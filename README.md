## DSA & DAA Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** and **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** code archive!

This repository contains **some problems** that I solved during my **initial learning stage of DSA & DAA** in my **2nd year journey as a CSE student**. I'm uploading these here mainly for **storage, backup**, and to **organize my work** for easier future reference.

## Lab Reports

**DAA_Lab_Report.pdf** – A documentation of my DAA practice and implementation.

The report includes:
- Brief theory and algorithm for each problem  
- Code screenshots  
- Input/output screenshots  
- Graphs and diagrams created using online tools/websites  
- Sample input styles used during testing

> **Note:** Author and committer dates are backdated to accurately reflect the original time when these programs were created during my learning period.
